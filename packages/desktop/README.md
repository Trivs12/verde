# `verde` Desktop

This package contains Verde's standalone Zig desktop app. It uses SDL3, SDL_GPU, and [`palette`](../palette), Verde's in-repo Zig GUI framework.

## Prerequisites

- Zig `0.16.0` through the repo-root [`mise.toml`](../../mise.toml)
- SDL3 development files for your platform
- Provider setup for the providers you want to use:
  - Codex: `codex` on your `PATH` and `codex login`
  - Claude Code: Claude Code installed and logged in locally; Verde talks to it through Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK
  - OpenCode: `opencode` on your `PATH`
  - Cursor: Cursor CLI `agent` on your `PATH` and `agent login`, or `CURSOR_API_KEY` for headless environments
  - Pi: `pi` on your `PATH` for GUI chat (`pi --mode rpc`) and its terminal TUI
  - FX: `fx` on your `PATH` and `fx login` for GUI chat (`fx acp`) and its terminal TUI
  - Grok Build: `grok` on your `PATH` and `grok login` for GUI chat (`grok agent stdio`) and its terminal TUI
  - Amp: `amp` on your `PATH` for its terminal TUI

## Development

Run development tasks from the repo root with `mise`:

```bash
mise install
mise run setup
mise run dev
```

Common tasks:

- `mise run setup`: checks desktop build dependencies.
- `mise run dev`: builds and runs Verde from the repo-local Zig build output with the native webview backend.
- `mise run run`: builds and launches Verde in development mode.
- `mise run debug`: launches Verde with the in-app diagnostics window enabled.
- `mise run build`: creates a local release-style build for the current platform.
- `mise run check-mac-webview`: on macOS, rebuilds/installs the WKWebView app and runs automated package/runtime readiness checks, including Swift packaging and native-keyboard ownership guards.
- `mise run mac-webview-manual-signoff`: on macOS, runs the guided foreground physical-input signoff flow and writes a timestamped evidence run.
- `mise run check-mac-webview-manual`: on macOS, checks the latest timestamped physical-input evidence run required for final WKWebView signoff.
- `mise run dev-sdl-gpu`: runs with the SDL_GPU Palette renderer.

### Hyprland UI Polish Checks

For chat UI readability or DPI polish work, run Verde from the repo root and capture comparison screenshots into `goal_samples/`:

```bash
mise run dev
hyprctl clients -j
grim -g "$(slurp)" goal_samples/chat-after.png
```

Use the same approximate window size for before/after captures. For fractional-scale checks, adjust your Hyprland monitor scale, restart `mise run dev`, then capture another image such as `goal_samples/chat-after-1-25x.png`.

## Browser Pane

The in-app browser pane defaults to the host platform webview stack: WPE WebKit on
Linux, WKWebView on macOS, and WebView2 on Windows. Default development and
release-style builds use these native runtimes.

Native-webview source build requirements:

- Linux: WPE WebKit development/runtime packages.
- macOS: AppKit and WebKit from the platform SDK.
- Windows: Microsoft WebView2 SDK headers at compile time, the WebView2 Runtime
  at runtime, and `WebView2Loader.dll` next to `verde.exe` or on the DLL search
  path.

Useful environment variables:

- `VERDE_OPEN_BROWSER_ON_START=1`: smoke-test the browser pane during startup.
- `VERDE_BROWSER_START_URL=https://example.com`: navigate the startup browser smoke to a specific URL; bare hostnames are normalized the same way as the URL bar.
- `VERDE_BROWSER_START_EVAL='document.title'`: run one JavaScript eval after the startup smoke page loads.
- `VERDE_BROWSER_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_BRIDGE=1`: explicitly allow page-to-host bridge messages from non-app and non-localhost pages for local diagnostics. By default, privileged bridge messages are accepted only from `app://`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `[::1]` pages.
- `VERDE_BROWSER_LINUX_SHOW_HELPER=1`: force the Linux visible helper window on X11-style sessions.
- `VERDE_BROWSER_LINUX_UNSAFE_WAYLAND_HELPER=1`: allow the diagnostic Linux helper window on Wayland; Hyprland uses `snapshot_texture` by default because this helper is not release parity there.

## Embedded Terminal

The desktop shell includes embedded terminal panes powered by Ghostty's `libghostty-vt`.

- Open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` to search threads, jump to panes, switch workspaces, or run an app command.
- With prefix mode enabled, create a terminal pane with `Ctrl+B`, then `Shift+T`.
- Move between workspace panes with `Ctrl+Arrow`.
- Vim-style `Ctrl+H/J/K/L` focus remains available through `keybinds.workspace.focus_*` overrides in `verde.json`.
- With two or more tiled panes, use horizontal touchpad/wheel gestures for a horizontal strip, or `Ctrl`+vertical wheel for a vertical strip; each axis persists per workspace.
- It starts in the selected project's directory.
- `Ctrl+-` and `Ctrl+=` adjust only the terminal font scale while the terminal is focused.

Use `mise run debug` when you need the diagnostics window for focus, input-routing, or terminal hitbox debugging.

## Providers

The desktop app talks to local provider runtimes rather than a hosted Verde backend.

- Codex uses the local `codex` CLI and starts `codex app-server` automatically when needed.
- Claude Code uses Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK and requires Claude Code to be installed and logged in on your machine.
- OpenCode uses the local `opencode` CLI and can start `opencode serve` automatically when needed.
- Cursor uses the local Cursor CLI ACP server (`agent acp`) and requires `agent login` or `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
- Pi uses the local `pi` CLI in RPC mode (`pi --mode rpc`), one process per turn; it can also launch as a terminal TUI.
- FX uses the local `fx` CLI ACP server (`fx acp`) and requires `fx login`; it can also launch as a terminal TUI.
- Grok Build uses the local `grok` CLI ACP server (`grok agent stdio`) and requires `grok login`; it can also launch as a terminal TUI.
- Amp is TUI-only: Verde launches the `amp` CLI in an embedded terminal pane.

Requests run against the project directory selected in Verde. If prompt sending fails, check that the selected provider is installed, available to Verde's launch environment, and authenticated.

## State And Config

App state is stored through SDL's pref path in `state.sqlite`. User config is loaded from:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/verde/verde.json`
- `~/.config/verde/verde.json`

On Omarchy systems, Palette UI colors are loaded from Omarchy-compatible `colors.toml` files. Set `VERDE_OMARCHY_COLORS` to a specific file for testing, use the active Omarchy Quattro theme at `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` (with the pre-Quattro config path retained as a fallback), or place a theme at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/omarchy/themes/verde/colors.toml` / `~/.config/omarchy/themes/verde/colors.toml`. Verde maps `background`, `foreground`, `accent`, `selection_background`, and `color0` through `color8` into semantic UI tokens and keeps built-in fallbacks for missing keys. `theme.colors` in `verde.json` can override those tokens; omit `theme.theme` to keep Omarchy auto-detection, or set it to `"default"` to start from Verde's built-in colors.

Config supports UI and terminal font size, scrolling-pane activation and spacing, keybind overrides, and the default action behind the main `Open` button plus `Alt+O`. Settings can override scrolling mode and threshold for the currently selected workspace; clearing the override returns it to these global values. Drag a scrolling pane's trailing edge to set a persistent workspace column width, and use the reset-width command to return to the configured panes-per-view sizing.

  "theme": {
    "colors": {

      "pane_next": "Ctrl+Tab",
      "active_previous": "Alt+Left",
      "active_next": "Alt+Right"
    },
    "terminal": {
      "toggle": null,
      "new_tab": "CommandOrControl+Alt+T",
      "close": "CommandOrControl+Shift+W",
      "rename_tab": "CommandOrControl+Shift+R",
      "tab_previous": "CommandOrControl+Shift+PageUp",
      "tab_next": "CommandOrControl+Shift+PageDown",
      "split_up": null,
      "split_down": null,
      "split_left": null,
      "split_right": null,
      "focus_up": "CommandOrControl+Alt+Up",
      "focus_down": "CommandOrControl+Alt+Down",
      "focus_left": "CommandOrControl+Alt+Left",
      "focus_right": "CommandOrControl+Alt+Right"
    }
  }
}
```

Keybind values can be a string, a string array, `null`, an empty string, or an empty array. `null` and empty values disable that binding.
`new_thread` and `workspace.split_terminal_horizontal` are unbound by default;
the sample above shows how to opt back into their former direct shortcuts.

`keybinds.prefix` configures tmux-style prefix mode (on by default). `"prefix": false` disables it. By default, prefix mode arms `Ctrl+B` with a default table that covers every built-in command; `"prefix": "Ctrl+A"` changes the chord; the object form (`enabled`, `key`, `defaults`, `bindings`) lets you bind any action name or a `{ "command": "..." }` shell script to `prefix + key`. While armed, a status bar shows the escape hatches and `?` opens the full cheat sheet. See the website keybinds docs for the full table.
The nested `chat` bindings only run while a GUI chat pane is focused; they do not intercept input in terminal or browser panes. The model picker includes initial provider selection on a fresh thread.

`open.default` accepts `folder`, `editor`, `cursor`, `vscode`, `zed`, or a custom shell action:

```json
{
  "open": {
    "default": {
      "label": "Workbench",
      "action": "cursor ."
    }
  }
}
```

Custom actions run through `sh -lc` with the selected project as the working directory. The command also receives the project path as `$1`.
